If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a\nClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,\nlike a ListView.\nThe specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#05d54 relayoutBoundary=up3 OVERFLOWING:\n  creator: Column ÔåÉ Expanded ÔåÉ Column ÔåÉ MediaQuery ÔåÉ Padding ÔåÉ SafeArea ÔåÉ\n    KeyedSubtree-[GlobalKey#ca7b2] ÔåÉ _BodyBuilder ÔåÉ MediaQuery ÔåÉ LayoutId-[<_ScaffoldSlot.body>] ÔåÉ\n    CustomMultiChildLayout ÔåÉ _ActionsScope ÔåÉ Ôï»\n  parentData: offset=Offset(169.6, 64.0); flex=1; fit=FlexFit.tight (can use size)\n  constraints: BoxConstraints(0.0<=w<=800.0, h=356.0)\n  size: Size(460.8, 356.0)\n  direction: vertical\n  mainAxisAlignment: center\n  mainAxisSize: max\n  crossAxisAlignment: center\n  verticalDirection: down\n  spacing: 0.0\nÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñÔùóÔùñ\nÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉÔòÉ","type":"print","time":53160}
